Time zones on earth are hard..

Ever tried scheduling a meeting with a collegue working from an office near the Schiaparelli crater on Mars?

The Schiaparelli crater is one hour ahead of Airy Mean Time, Mars' hours and days are longer than hours, and when is their weekend?

There is a lot of conflicting information on the date and time on Mars, and no apparent agreed standard.

For time, I primarily used:
National Aeronautics and Space Administration - Goddard Institute for Space Studies - Mars24 Sunclock â€” Time on Mars
https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/help/algorithm.html

For years, I used a sidereel year (a rotation of the sun) and the great dust storm of 1956 occuring on Year 1 as documented by Clancy et al.

Sols of the week, similar to days of the week (Monday, Tuesday...) are based of the Julian Date starting on Sunday and the Mars Year 0 starting on Monday. Although no clear standard, these were essential to a meeting planner as our collegues on Mars need to have time off on their weekends. Even if we move to 4 day work weeks on Earth and Mars - we will still continue to use the same 7 day week day names on Earth.

Please take caution when scheduling a meeting, as the delay in transmission can vary from several minutes to over 20 minutes depending on the distance between the planets and the communication network used. A video broadcast from Earth will not be received on Mars until the variable time has elapsed, the time for a response will experience the same delays - resulting in up to 40 minutes before questions are answered.
